## **Program:** ##

> Using ROS to communicate between Raspberry pi and Arduino and control auto mobile car.

## **Instruction** ##

CheckPoint folders are the src, scripts, launch and CMakeLists of the ros package in each check point.
  
sketchbook folder is the code for arduino.

- ## CheckPoint1 ##
  
  ### Goal ###
  
  1. Input a number in keyboard and publish it in a topic.
  2. Arduino subscribe to the topic and multiple input number with 2.
  3. Arduino publish a new topic with calculation result in it.
  4. Raspberry pi subscribe to the topic and show it on the screen.
  
  Run `roslaunch ros_pub_sub demo1.launch` to launch roscore, arduino_serial_node and demo1_node. 
  
- ## CheckPoint2 ##

  ### Goal ###

  1. Raspberry pi collects the desired velocity of motors from the keyboard and publish it in a topic.
  2. Arduino subscribes to the topic and controls motors with PID controller.
  
  Run `roslaunch demo2_pkg demo2.launch` to launch roscore, arduino_serial_node and demo2_node.
  
- ## CheckPoint3 ##

  ### Goal ###
  
  1. Raspberry pi collects sensors' data, including 3 touch sensors and 1 light sensor, and publish different mode in a topic to achieve obstacle avoidance and target, LED light bulb, searching.
  2. Arduino subscribe to the topic and controls motors with PID controller.

  Run `roslaunch demo3_pkg demo3.launch` to launch roscore, arduino_serial_node and rpi_node.
  
- ## CheckPoint4 ##

   ### Goal ###
   
  1. Raspberry pi collects sensors' data, including 3 touch snesors, 1 light sensor and 1 IR sensor, and publish different mode in a topic to achieve obstacle avoidance and target searching.
  2. Different from CheckPoint3, robot has to bring the target to specific place by using IR sensor after it collects the target.
  3. Arduino subscribe to the topic and controls motors with PID controller.

  Run `roslaunch demo4_pkg demo4.launch` to launch roscore, arduino_serial_node and rpi_node.
  
- ## RobotContest ##

  ### Goal ###

  1. Raspberry pi collects sensors' data, including 3 touch snesors, 1 light sensor and 1 IR sensor, and publish different mode in a topic to achieve obstacle avoidance and target searching.
  2. Different from CheckPoint3, robot has to bring the target to specific place by using IR sensor after it collects the target.
  3. Arduino subscribe to the topic and controls motors with PID controller.

  Run `roslaunch RobotContest Contest.launch` to launch roscore, arduino_serial_node and rpi_node.
  
- ## CoolRobotShow ##

  ### Goal ###

  1. The first node in the Raspberry pi continuously collects and publishes surrounding information by using RPi Lidar.
  2. The second node in the Raspberry pi determines which way is clear, front, right and left, by subscribing to the topic that published by the first node. And then, it controls the robot to move toward the direction that is clear. 
  3. Arduino subscribe to the topic and controls motors with PID controller

  Run `roslaunch CoolRobotShow final.launch` to launch roscore, arduino_serial_node and 2 rpi_node.
